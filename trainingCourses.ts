**Key Areas:**
- **System Status:** A large indicator showing the machine's current state: \`Ready\`, \`Running\`, \`Faulted\`, or \`E-Stop\`.
- **Production Counters:** Displays real-time data like \`Total Cuts\`, \`Product Count\`, and \`Reject Rate\`.
- **Pressure & Flow Gauges:** Digital gauges showing the live water pressure (PSI) and garnet flow.
- **Active Program:** Shows the name of the currently loaded cutting program (e.g., 'McCrispy Fillet').

Familiarize yourself with the normal operating values on this screen so you can spot problems quickly.

**Procedure:**
1. At the start of a new product run, navigate to this screen.
2. Scroll to and tap the correct program name.
3. Verify the Target Parameters match the spec sheet for the run.
4. Press the \`Load\` button. The system will confirm the program is active.

- **Conveyor Control:** Buttons to run the conveyor belt forward or backward at a slow speed.
- **Water Jet Test Fire:** A button to activate the water jet without moving the gantry. Used to check the stream quality.
- **Actuator Test:** Buttons to extend or retract individual cutting actuators.

Always ensure the area is clear before using any manual controls.

1.  Navigate to the 'Maintenance' screen, then select 'Cutter Adjustment'.
2.  The screen will show the current X and Y offset values (e.g., X: +0.1mm, Y: -0.05mm).
3.  Place a test piece of material (like a calibration mat or a test piece of poultry) on the belt.
4.  Use the 'Test Fire' function to make a single cut at the current zero position.
5.  Measure the deviation of the cut from the intended target point.
6.  Enter the correction into the X and Y fields. For example, if the cut is 2mm to the left (negative X direction), you would enter \`+2.0\` in the X offset field to move it back to the right.
7.  Save the new offset and perform another test fire to confirm the adjustment is correct.

It is a software multiplier that tells the vision system how "heavy" a piece of poultry is for its perceived size.

- **Higher Density Setting:** Tells the machine the product is heavy for its size. This will cause the machine to make **smaller** cuts to hit the target weight.
- **Lower Density Setting:** Tells the machine the product is light for its size. This will cause the machine to make **larger** cuts.

You must adjust this setting throughout the day as product temperature and water content change.`

**Procedure:**
1.  Load the correct program (e.g., \`BWW Boneless Wings\`).
2.  Run a sample of 5-10 pieces through the cutter.
3.  Carefully weigh each piece and calculate the average weight.
4.  Compare the average weight to the program's target weight.
5.  If the average is **under** the target, **decrease** the Density Setting in small increments (e.g., from 1.05 to 1.04).
6.  If the average is **over** the target, **increase** the Density Setting in small increments (e.g., from 1.05 to 1.06).
7.  Repeat the process until the average weight is consistently within the acceptable tolerance.
8.  Log the new density setting for your shift.`
